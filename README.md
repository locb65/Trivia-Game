# Trivia-Game
This is a simple Trivia Game created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Game Logic

The game logic follows these steps:

1. The page loads with a description of the game and a start button.
2. There are 10 questions in total that are hard coded and do not really have any commonality in subjects.
3. When the start button is clicked. It will iterate the first question with 4 choices for the each question.
4. When an answer is clicked it will iterate the next question while keeping track of whether the contestant was right or not in the background.
5. Onces all questions are answered, your score will be provided at the end screen along with a restart button.
6. When restart is clicked it will bring you back to the intro screen with a Start button to begin again.


### Techniques used

The techniques used are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
DOM techniques were used to make the trivia game interactive with the buttons.
Object oriented programming was used to develop the hard coded question bank and functions were invoked with each button click to iterate from from the bank.

### Possible future additions

1. A larger question bank either hard coded or by using an API. 
2. A couple different difficulties making either the questions harder or easier.
3. A time trial mode either to answer as many question correctly within a set time or a set time to answer a set number of questions and you fail if you cannot answer all questions.
